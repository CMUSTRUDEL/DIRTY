# DIRTY: Augmenting Decompiler Output with Learned Variable Names and Types

[**Code**](https://github.com/CMUSTRUDEL/DIRTY) | [**Paper PDF**](https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/ChenDIRTY2022.pdf) | [**Demo**](https://dirtdirty.github.io/explorer.html)

Original implementation for paper [Augmenting Decompiler Output with Learned Variable Names and Types](#common-issues).

**DIRTY** is a Transformer-based model which **improves the quality of decompiler outputs** by automatically generating meaningful variable names and types, assigning variable names that agree with those written by developers 66.4% of the time and types 75.8% of the time.
We also release a large real-world dataset **DIRT** for this task, which consists of 75K+ programs and 1M+ human-written C functions mined from GitHub paired with their decompiler outputs.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux with Python 3.6/3.7/3.8
- [PyTorch â‰¥ 1.5.1](https://pytorch.org/)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

### Training

#### Download DIRT

The first step to train DIRTY is to download the preprocessed DIRT dataset.
If you wish to obtain the original unpreprocessed dataset, please open an issue.

```bash
cd dirty/
wget cmu-itl.s3.amazonaws.com/dirty/dirt.tar.gz -O dirt.tar.gz
tar -xzf dirt.tar.gz
```

The command would automatically download and decompress the dataset from Amazon S3.
If your machine does not have access to AWS, please manually download from the above link and untar it to `data1/`.

#### Train DIRTY

We have setup configuration files for different models reported in our paper:

| file                      | model           | time (estimated hours) |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| multitask.xfmr.jsonnet    | DIRTY-Multitask | 120                    |
| rename.xfmr.jsonnet       | DIRTY-Rename    | 80                     |
| retype.xfmr.jsonnet       | DIRTY-Retype    | 80                     |
| retype_nomem.xfmr.jsonnet | DIRTY_NDL       | 80                     |
| retype_base.xfmr.jsonnet  | DIRTY_S         | 40                     |

Training a models is as easy as specifying the name of the experimental run and the config file.
Suppose we want to reproduce the Multi-task model in Table~7 in the paper:

```bash
cd dirty/
python exp.py train --cuda --expname=dirty_mt multitask.xfmr.jsonnet
```

Then, please watch for the line `wandb: Run data is saved locally in ...` in the output.
This is where the logs and models are to be saved.
You can also monitor the automatically uploaded training and validation status (e.g., losses, accuracy) in your browser in real-time with the link printed after `wandb: ðŸš€ View run at ...`.

Feel free to adjust the hyperparameters in `*.jsonnet` config files to train your own model.

### Inference

#### Download Trained Model

As an alternative to train the model by yourself, you can download our trained DIRTY model.

```bash
cd dirty/
mkdir exp_runs/
wget cmu-itl.s3.amazonaws.com/dirty/dirty_mt.ckpt -O exp_runs/dirty_mt.ckpt
```

#### Test DIRTY

First, run your trained/downloaded model to produce predictions on the DIRE test set.

```
python exp.py train --cuda --expname=eval_dirty_mt multitask.xfmr.jsonnet --eval-ckpt <ckpt_path>
```

`<ckpt_path>` is either `exp_runs/dirty_mt.ckpt` if you download our trained model,
or saved during training at `wandb/run-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-XXXXXXXX/files/dire/XXXXXXXX/checkpoints/epoch=N.ckpt`.

We sugguest changing `beam_size` in config files to `0` to switch to greedy decoding, which is significantly faster.
The default configuration of `beam_size = 5` can take hours.

The predictions will be saved to `pred_XXX.json`.
This filename depends on models and can be modified in config files.
You can inspect the prediction results, which is in the following format.

```python
{
  binary: {
    func_name: {
      var1: [var1_retype, var1_rename], ...
    }, ...
  }, ...
}
```

Finally, use our standalone benchmark script:

```
python -m utils.evaluate --pred-file pred_mt.json --config-file multitask.xfmr.jsonnet
```
